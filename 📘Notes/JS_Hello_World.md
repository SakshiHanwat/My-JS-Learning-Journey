# 🌍 JavaScript Hello World

## 📝 Overview

The **JavaScript "Hello World"** program is a traditional first step for every programmer when learning a new language.  
It simply displays the text `"Hello, World!"` — helping you understand how to **output text and run simple scripts**.

## 💻 1. Using the Browser Console

The easiest way to run JavaScript is through your **browser’s developer console**.

### 🪜 Steps:

1. Open your web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
2. Press **F12** or **Ctrl + Shift + I** (on Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + Opt + I** (on Mac).
3. Go to the **Console** tab.
4. Type the following JavaScript code and press Enter 👇

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");

🧩 Output:
Hello, World!

🧠 This command prints text to the console — great for debugging or learning basic syntax.


🧾 2. Using an HTML File

You can also embed JavaScript directly into an HTML file — this is how JS usually runs on websites.

🪜 Steps:

Open VS Code or any text editor.

Create a new file and save it as hello-world.html.

Write the following code 👇

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World in JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        alert("Hello, World!");
    </script>
</body>
</html>


Save the file and open it in a web browser.

A popup alert saying “Hello, World!” will appear 🎉

📂 3. Using an External JavaScript File

For real-world applications, you should separate your HTML and JavaScript into different files — this makes your code clean and reusable.

🪜 Steps:

Create two files in the same folder:

index.html

script.js

Add the following code to index.html 👇

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World in JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>


Then write this in script.js 👇

console.log("Hello, World!");


Open index.html in your browser and check the Console tab —
You’ll see:

Hello, World!

🧠 Conclusion

The Hello World program is the foundation of learning JavaScript.
It teaches you how to:

Output text using console.log() or alert()

Run JavaScript inside a browser console or HTML page

Use external .js files for better project structure

This small step is the starting point of your JavaScript journey 🚀
